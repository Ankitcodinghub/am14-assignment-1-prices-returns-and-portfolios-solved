Assignment 1 (week 1): Prices, Returns, and Portfolios

This assignment gets you started working with prices and returns. You should do everything in R even though we are only working with six different stocks and it is possible to do some things manually. If you have a sample of hundreds of stocks this might become more difficult.

<ol>
<li>Go to CANVAS and download the data for PS1 Monthly.xlsx. The data was downloaded from the CRSP (The Center for Research in Security Prices) data base via WRDS (Wharton Research Service) that is available for LBS students. Note the file contains data about Microsoft, Exxon Mobil (previously Exxon), General Electric, JP Morgan Chase (previously Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan), Intel, Citigroup (previously Primerica and Travellers Group). In addition, the columns vwretd (ewretd) and vwredx (ewretx) contain value-weighted (equal-weighted) total returns and total returns excluding dividends for the CRSP index that contains stocks from NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ. Finally, sprtrn contains the total return for the S&amp;P 500 Composite Index.</li>
<li>Use the holding period returns (RET) to create a total return index for the MSFT and GE stocks and the S&amp;P 500 index, which shows the theoretical growth in value of an investment in the stock assuming that dividends are reinvested (normalize the start value to 1). That is, simply assume you invest 1 $ in each of the three assets and compound the returns. Do the same for the returns that abstract from dividend payments (i.e., use RETX instead). Plot the investments with and without dividends for each stock separately. How do dividends affect the results?</li>
<li>The holding period returns are simple returns. Generate a new variable that contains the corresponding log returns (LRET). Calculate the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the normal and the log returns. Plot the normal against the log returns for MSFT. Briefly discuss your results!</li>
<li>Go to CANVAS and download the data for PS1 Daily.xlsx. This file contains two worksheets. HPR Daily contains the daily holding period returns for the six stocks, the S&amp;P 500 Composite Index and the value-weighted market portfolio (including dividends) from CRSP. Prices Daily contains the prices for the six stocks and the S&amp;P 500 Composite Index.</li>
<li>Construct a daily total return index for MSFT and GE stocks and the S&amp;P 500 index and plot them against each other. Compare your results with the monthly total return indices from above. Are there any differences? Discuss.</li>
<li>As before, the holding period returns are simple returns. Create log returns. Calculate the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis of the normal and log returns. Compare and discuss your results with the results from monthly frequency.</li>
<li>Compare the statistical properties of the log holding period return time series both for monthly and daily returns. Plot a histogram and discuss how the empirical distributions relate to the normal distribution.</li>
<li>Pick three stocks and the S&amp;P 500 index (either you can use MSFT, GE and JPM or adapt the code to pick three random stocks). You will need the holding period returns (both normal and log returns) and the total return indices you created.</li>

<li>Use the three assets and make up a portfolio by assigning arbitrary portfolio weights. What does it imply if you keep the weights fixed over time?</li>
<li>Using the portfolio weights and assets from above, calculate the corresponding portfolio returns. More- over, use the portfolio returns to calculate the evolution of a $ 1 investment in the portfolio over the sample period.

Assignment 3 (weeks 2, 3, and 4): CAPM, APT, and Modelling Financial Risk

Due: Sunday, 6 February 2022, 9:00 p.m. Submit your solutions via the course‚Äôs CANVAS page. 1. Note: use value-weighted rather than equal-weighted returns for your analysis.

<ul>
<li>Go to Kenneth French‚Äôs webpage https://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/ken.french/data library.html and down- load the 25 portfolios formed on size and book-to-market (25 Portfolios Formed on Size and Book-to-Market (5 √ó 5)) at the monthly frequency. In addition, also download the Fama/French 3 factors (Fama/French 3 Factors) at the monthly frequency.</li>
<li>Run the following regressions:

ri,t ‚àí rf,t = Œ±i + Œ≤i (rMKT,t ‚àí rf,t) + oÃ®i,t

where ri,t is the return of one of the 25 portfolios formed on size and book-to-market, rMKT,t is the return on the market, and rf is the monthly riskless rate.
</li>
<li>Plot the mean realized excess returns of the 25 portfolios (i.e., for each portfolio, plot the time- series mean of ri,t ‚àí rf,t) against the predicted expected excess returns implied by the CAPM regressions above (i.e., a time-series mean of Œ≤ÀÜi (rMKT,t ‚àí rf,t) ). Critically discuss the pricing ability of CAPM.</li>
<li>Now run the following regressions:

ri,t ‚àí rf,t = Œ±i + Œ≤i (rMKT,t ‚àí rf,t) + Œ≥irSMB,t + Œ¥irHML,t + oÃ®i,t

where rSMB,t is the return on size factor and rHML,t is the return on book-to-market factor.

As before, plot mean realized excess returns against the predicted excess returns implied by the regression model. How do the results compare to the ones from above?

Assess whether the Fama-French three factor model is able to price these different cross-sections. What do you conclude?</li>
<li>You decide that you would like to enrich the Fama-French three factor model with a momentum factor (for some details on the momentum factor have a look at the appendix of the lecture slides and read the paper ‚ÄùMomentum‚Äù by Jegadeesh and Titman on CANVAS). How would you do this? Explain in detail. (hint: no need to do anything! Simply describe what you would do in order to add a momentum factor to your three factor model. Also note that you can assume access to to Kenneth French‚Äôs data library)</li>
<li>Comment on the following statements:
<ul>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;The Fama-French three factor model is as good as it gets. Hence, we should always use this model.</li>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;As the Fama-French three factor model performs empirically superior to the CAPM, we might as well forget about CAPM entirely.</li>
<li>‚Äì &nbsp;Empirically, the best factor model has three factors.</li>

Problem Set 4 (weeks 4 and 5): Measuring Financial Risk and Big Data

Due: Sunday, 13 February 2022, 9:00 p.m. Submit your solutions via the course‚Äôs CANVAS page. 1. Measuring Financial Risk:

A short introduction to Value at Risk:

Value at risk (VaR) is a statistical measure of the riskiness of financial entities or portfolios of assets. It is defined as the maximum dollar (or any other currency) amount expected to be lost over a given time horizon, at a pre-defined confidence level. For example, if the 95% one-month VAR is $1 million, there is 95% confidence that over the next month the portfolio will not lose more than $1 million.

VaR can be calculated using different techniques. Under the parametric method, also known as variance-covariance method, VaR is calculated as a function of mean and standard deviation of the return series, assuming that returns are normally distributed.

The parametric method is the most widely used VaR in practice as one only needs to know the mean and the standard deviation of a return series of interest. However, the parametric method crucially relies on the assumption that returns are serially independent and normally distributed. These are potentially very restrictive assumptions as we have discussed in lecture: 1) returns might be autocorrelated ‚Äì in particular, during a crisis and 2) high frequency returns are clearly not normally distributed. On the bright side, these assumptions make the calculation of VaR much easier. First, assuming serial independence, allows us to abstract from estimating serial correlations. Second, assuming normality allows for computation of a standard normal z score to determine the risk position with a degree of confidence right off of a standard normal table. Hence, normality is an important assumption because it allows for the use of the normal distribution as a proxy for what expected returns might look like.

An example of a parametric VaR calculation is as follows: Monthly standard deviation (in $ terms): $50,000 Monthly mean (in $ terms): $35,000

Z Score for 95% confidence: 1.65

The monthly VaR with 95% confidence is: 35,000 ‚Äì 50,000 (1.65) = -$47,500

Alternatively, one could express the VaR in percent rather than $. For example, suppose the daily mean return of a portfolio is 0.1%, the standard deviation is 5%, and we are interested in a 99% confidence level which implies a z score of 2.33.

The daily VaR with 99% confidence is: 0.1% ‚Äì 5% (2.33) = ‚Äì 11.55%

‚Ä¢ Implementing Value at Risk (VaR) in R

‚Äì Pick three stocks from the daily stock returns data set (PS1 Daily.xlsx) and transform these simple returns to log returns.

‚Äì Estimate three volatility time series for each of these three stocks by either using a MA (10 weeks) or an EWMA (Œª = 0.94 and œÉ2 = 1 Ùè∞ÉT œÉ2, where T is number of observations of

daily returns in your sample) model.

</div>
</div>
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
0 T t=1 t

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="page" title="Page 9">
<div class="layoutArea">
<div class="column">
Based on these six time series (two volatility time series for each of the three stocks) calculate the daily one day Value-at-Risk (VaR) 95% assuming normality. That is, you should use the estimated volatility time series together with the following formula for conditional VaR assuming normality

VaR95%,t =r ÃÑ‚àíŒ¶‚àí1(0.05)√óœÉt,

where r ÃÑ is the mean return (i.e., the average return of the return series of interest up to time t), Œ¶‚àí1 is the inverse of the standard normal cumulative density function and, hence, Œ¶‚àí1(0.05) = 1.65 (the z score!). Moreover, œÉt is your estimated volatility at time t.

In a last step, you are supposed to ‚Äùbacktest‚Äù your VaR estimates. That is, for each stock you now have three VaR series as well as the realized returns. With this data, count for each VaR estimate separately the number of violations. In other words, count the negative realized market returns that are more extreme than the VaR on this given day. For example, a violation of VaR occurs on a day when the realized returns is -9% and the VaR is -8%. How many violations would you expect if your VaR estimates were to be accurate (i.e., true)? How many violations do you observe? What do you conclude?

How many principal components are needed to explain the majority of the variation in the yields (hint: run prcomp on the yields and not on changes in yields)? Extract the first three components and plot them in a time series plot (again, you can extract them as discussed above).</li>

<li>Calculate the correlation between the first component and the 3-year yield and the second component and the difference between the 10-year and the 1-year yield. What is the economic intuition for these components?</li>
<li>The following materials discuss what happens when one uses historical data to determine optimal portfolio weights. In other words, you use historical return data to calculate the weights of the tangency portfolio, i.e. the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio (highest return per unit of risk). In a next step, you then invest accordingly and see what happens out of sample. The hope is, that this procedure leads to very high risk-adjusted returns out of sample (i.e. high Sharpe ratios). However, as you can see from the additional lecture notes, a simple strategy that invests an equal amount in every asset, in other words you would invest 1/N of your wealth in each of the N assets, greatly outperforms the first strategy. What happened? The problem is that we tend to overfit the data in sample which leads to bad results. What can we do to improve on our performance? One possibility is to use a methodology that relies on shrinkage such as ridge, shrinkage to the mean, or lasso. You don‚Äôt need to answer any questions in this part of the assignment. Your task is simply to download the relevant files and run the R code which exemplifies how the various shrinkage methodologies can be implemented.
<ul>
<li>Go to CANVAS and download the pdf file Lecture 5plus.pdf, the data files industry49.xls and rf.xls, and the R code Code Lecture5 plus.R.</li>
<li>Read the slides in Lecture 5plus.pdf and run the code simultaneously in order to understand how the various graphs are generated.</li>
<li>While 1/N is hard to beat in general, one could improve on ridge and lasso by optimally choosing the shrinkage parameters.</li>
